🚀 **EvoGrayNet**: Colon Polyp Detection and Segmentation using Evolutionary Network Architecture Search  

**🚀 Advanced detection and segmentation of colon polyps in endoscopy images**  

📌 **Full code and pretrained models will be released soon!**

## 🔍 Abstract  
Accurate colon polyp detection and segmentation in colonoscopy images remain challenging due to variability in appearance, size, and location. EvoGrayNet addresses this by integrating:  
- **Gray Module**: Combines standard/depthwise separable convolutions with batch normalization and dropout to capture local-global features.  
- **Lightweight Attention Gate (AG)**: Refines feature maps for low-contrast regions and precise localization.  
- **Dilated Feature Extractor (DFE)**: Captures multiscale spatial context via dilated convolutions.  
- **Feature Recalibration (FR)**: Dynamically enhances channel-wise feature importance.  

An **evolutionary architecture search** optimizes the model via crossover/mutation, maximizing Dice coefficient performance. EvoGrayNet outperforms 11 existing methods across 4 public datasets, achieving higher accuracy, lower FLOPs, and better generalization.
